Title: A fun book for kids and adults to do together
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 24, 2007
Review: My sons (age 4 and 8) and I adore these books - I only wish they made more in the series. The books are simply laid out enough that a young kid could do the book by himself....if he has reading skills. Although I don't recall a beheading mentioned in the other review, smaller kids who can't read would need an adult to help them. In addition to being fun to search through, these books expose kids to a wide range of artistic periods - from both the East and the West. The books are also a good present for a 6th or 7th birthday - who needs another toy clogging up the toy box?

Title: I greatly enjoy this book

Review: I greatly enjoy this book. The illustrations are beautiful and it has done exactly what I hoped it would do, draw my children in to incredible art and cause them to really look at while still being fun and exciting. This is a series I would enjoy having every book of.

Title: Violent - what were they thinking? Good concept, poor choices.
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 29, 2005
Review: I purchased this book to give as a gift to my nephew. When it arrived, I opened the book to the middle and I could not believe what I was looking at. One of the art scenes is of a battle where a man charging on a horse has been decapitated. Blood is spewing from the headless neck, his necklace is falling in one direction, and his separated head (with a horror/surprise look on his face) is falling to the ground behind the horse. This is very gruesome, and there is no way I could give this as a gift a child of any age.

Wondering what could be worse, I turned the page to find another battle scene. One man is being struck to the back of the head with a club/mace and his head is caved by the blow. I am not making this up, the head is split open and details are painted. Many others in this same art work lie dead and dieing with arrows in their heads and torsos.

I look at the next artwork, and a man is pinning another to the ground while he slices his throat with a knife.

Why would someone pick these art works? Why would the editors allow them? I'm still stunned that this would make it print.

Review: I have the book "Can You Find It" I teach k-12 art and all of my students love looking for the items. I love the fact that they are not only being exposed to a variety of art ....but that it forces them to really look at the art. Win Win

Title: My 5 yr old is in love with this book
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 8, 2010
Review: My 5 yr old son picked this book up from the library and we've had to renew it twice because we can't bear to let it go. I love how it makes art fun and interesting, and teaches them how to love it at a young age. I recognized some of the pieces, and I loved the range from whimsical and light hearted to darker and deeper. I have a pretty low tolerance for violence, but I found it provided a good platform for talking to kids about things they'd otherwise be sheltered from.

You could look at each one of the paintings in this book for hours and never get bored. They are way more fascinating and far more beautiful than Where's Waldo, or the I spy books.
